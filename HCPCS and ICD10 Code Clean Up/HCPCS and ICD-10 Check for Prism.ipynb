    "# Automate HCPCS and ICD-10 Check for Prism\n",
    "\n",
    "Every quarter, the business requests HCPCS and ICD10 Codes to be updated in the master list for **Prism**, **Que**, **Salesforce**, and **Essette**. This script is used to format files to update and create new HCPCS in Salesforce.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script will format the file given by the business into a format that is acceptable by Salesforce.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- No prior knowledge of Python is required to run this script. However, that knowledge will help you understand the logic and syntax of the script. Specifically, we will be using the **pandas** library to transpose the file given by the business to a DataFrame, then we will use that DataFrame to create a new DataFrame with the necessary information. We will also be using the **datetime** library specifically for naming conventions of our file.\n",
    "- You will need to **rename** the file given by the business to **request.csv**. If this step is not done, then this script **will not run** properly.\n",
    "- You will need to save this Jupyter Notebook and the file **request.csv** in the same directory, e.g. in the same location on your local machine.\n",
    "- You will need a method to run Jupyter Notebooks on your local machine. This script assumes Anaconda has already been installed to your local machine. If Anaconda is not installed in your local machine, then you will need to install it via https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the Process\n",
    "This script will read the files **request.csv** and **salesforce.csv** and load them into a DataFrame using the pandas library. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since Salesforce only cares about the following columns, we will also strip the unnecessary columns from **request**. The columns we will be using from **request** are\n",
    "- **HCPCS**\n",
    "- **Long Description**\n",
    "- **Short Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using all columns from **salesforce**. After we read the files, we will then join **salesforce** onto **request** via the **HCPCS** column. Finally, we will compare columns to find\n",
    "1. HCPCS that need to be created in Salesforce\n",
    "2. HCPCS that need to have Long Description updated in Salesforce\n",
    "3. HCPCS that need to have Short Description updated in Salesforce\n",
    "4. HCPCS that need to be marked as Inactive in Salesforce\n",
    "5. HPCCS that need no changes \n",
    "\n",
    "Everything will be outputed to their own separate .csv files.\n",
