    "# Automate HCPCS Formating for Essette\n",
    "\n",
    "Every quarter, the business requests HCPCS and ICD10 Codes to be updated in the master list for **Prism**, **Que**, **Salesforce**, and **Essette**. This script is used to format a file for Essette.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script will format the file given by the business into a format that is acceptable by Essette.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- No prior knowledge of Python is required to run this script. However, that knowledge will help you understand the logic and syntax of the script. Specifically, we will be using the **pandas** library to transpose the file given by the business to a DataFrame, then we will use that DataFrame to create a new DataFrame with the necessary information. We will also be using the **datetime** library specifically for naming conventions of our file.\n",
    "- You will need to **rename** the file given by the business to **request.csv**. If this step is not done, then this script **will not run** properly.\n",
    "- You will need to save this Jupyter Notebook and the file **request.csv** in the same directory, e.g. in the same location on your local machine.\n",
    "- You will need a method to run Jupyter Notebooks on your local machine. This script assumes Anaconda has already been installed to your local machine. If Anaconda is not installed in your local machine, then you will need to install it via https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the Process\n",
    "This script will read the filename **request.csv** and load it into a DataFrame using the pandas library. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will then use that DataFrame to make a new DataFrame with the following schema:\n",
    "- **StagedForRemoval** = 0 (Note: We are assuming codes are not Staged for Removal. If Removal is needed, then they will need to be changed manually)\n",
    "- **TenantCode** = IP\n",
    "- **TypeCode** = CD.Service\n",
    "- **ParentCode** = HCPCS\n",
    "- **Code** = the HCPCS Code listed in the file called **request.csv**\n",
    "- **Description** = the Short Description listed in the file called **request.csv**\n",
    "- **AlternateDescription** = the Long Description listed in the file called **request.csv**\n",
    "- **StartDate** = the Code Start Date listed in the file called **request.csv**\n",
    "- **EndDate** = the Code End Date listed in the file called **request.csv**"
